CommChannelDemo Solution
- Demonstrates a CommService, implemented with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF),
  that sends instances of a message class between EndPoints, using the WSHttp protocol.
- Three application packages are provided: Client, Server, and CommChannelDemo.
- Client and Server demonstrate typical usage by applications and should serve as
  a model for your Project #4 code.
- CommChannelDemo uses two instances of the Comm<T> class in a single process.
  Usually you would only use one instance of Comm<T> in a process, but using two
  made it easier to test quickly.
- The Message package implements the construction of basic messages.
- MessageTest provides two classes, TestElement and TestRequest, used to build
  TestRequest messages.  For these we serialize an instance of a TestRequest
  to XML to send as the body string in a message.  It would be a good idea to use
  this package to create factory functions for all of the messages you need to
  send for your Project #4 code.
- Serialization provides support for making message bodies from Data Structure
  class instances like TestRequest.

I intentionally have not provided any file handling capability, leaving that to you
to complete the Channel processing functionality.  You will find the demos:
TimedFileStreaming and FileService-SelfHost useful to complete that capability.

Running Demo:
- Select "Set Startup Projects" by right-clicking on the solution and check
  Server and Client
- Rebuild solution and run.
